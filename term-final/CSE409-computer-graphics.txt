Fatema Madam
------------
(I was hoping Fatema madam would give a syllabus by this time....
 since that is not the case here's a rough sketch.
 Consider this to be a syllabus under construction unless stated as final.
 She did personally tell me once she would post the answers to first class test.
 I vaguely remember her telling in the class she would provide a syllabus too.
 So I am actually still hoping to get one, even if it is late.)

* read the books before the slides.
* try to solve the problems by yourself first.
* solve the class test problems. similar problems will appear in the final exam.
* contact me for any farther query.
	

further suggestions from Rabban sir:
------------------------------------
Some topics discussed in class are not explained in details in the reference books or slides,
which include:
- why homogeneous representation is more suitable than cartesian representation for representing transformations.
- proof of the properties of rotation matrices.
- why parametric polynomials of degree of at least 3 are required to represent non-planar curves in 3D.
Depend on class lectures for the above problems.

Solve the following problems.
Derive the composite transformation matrix that transforms:
(1) A(1,2), B(3,2), C(3,5), D(1,5) to A'(3,2), B'(3,5), C'(1,5), D'(1,2) respectively
(2) A(0,a), B(-a,0), C(a,0) to A'(a,a), B'(0,a) ,C'(a,0) respectively 
(3) A(0,a), B(-a,0), C(a,0) to A'(0,a), B'(0,-a) ,C'(a,0) respectively
(4) A(2,1), B(7,1), C(7,4), D(2,4) to A'(2,1), B'(7,0), C'(9,3), D'(4,4) respectively (Hint: simultaneous shearing can be used. observe that simultaneous shearing transforms rectangles into parallelograms.)
