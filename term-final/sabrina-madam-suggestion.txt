Ratio Analysis
--------------
??? Have doubts about page numbers
    Could not map in my book
    The following page numbers were given in the class

-> no need to read slide
-> read from book (787), summary (798)
-> comprehensive problem (806)
-> P18-2 (Villa Tool Company) - page 831
-> math from soft copy

***Practice maths, as problems are large and hard
   to complete in a given time frame - madam's suggestion
