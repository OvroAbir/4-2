It's actually quite hard to understand the title of the sheets,
as students photocopier arranged them in different way in different times
(like attaching two sheets together once whereas detaching those two at others), 
so I basically wrote down the topics instead of the sole title of the sheet.

           The concept of Economics
           Economics and Engineering Education

Lecture 2: The Production-Possibility Frontier
           Putting the PPF to Work

Lecture 3: Microeconomics vs Macroeconomics
           The Cardinal Utility Theory
           Maximization of Consumer's Satisfaction - Cardinal Approach
           Mathematical Derivation of Consumer's Equilibrium - Cardinal Approach
           Consumer Demand Theory - Marginal Utility Analysis

Lecture 4: Theory of Demand, Supply and Market Equilibrium
