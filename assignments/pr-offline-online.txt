Topic: Edit Distance
--------------------
We have to find the minimum distance between two given words.
If a word is "hello" and another one is "hola", the distance is 3.
Here's how:
	-> h common, OK (current cost = 0)
	-> change e to o (current cost = 1)
	-> l common, OK (current cost = 1)
	-> change l to a (current cost = 2)
	-> delete o (current cost = 3)
Here I've assumed cost to delete, insert and substitue are same (1).



Requirements:
-------------
Let us assume we will change X to Y.

1.
--
There is a DP approach where using len(X)*len(Y) memory we can compute
the distance, along with the path. We have to bring this one.

2.
--
There is a way to find the cost only (not the path) by using
2*len(X) or 2*len(Y) memory. We to have bring this one too.

3.
--
There is another way where using 2*len(X) or 2*len(Y) memory we
can find both the cost and the path. If we can bring this, that's cool.
If we can't, that's also cool. But in that case we will have to do
this as online, where we will be given specific instructions on how to 
do so.
