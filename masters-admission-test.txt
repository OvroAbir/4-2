Ok, so I'm running low on both facts and ideas...everybody chip in please :)
If anyone has talked to immediate seniors about the admission test, kindly get in touch with me via gmail (saquib2527).
I'll update the contents accordingly.

What I gathered talking to Taufiq Vai
-------------------------------------
1. Read the slides
2. Network/communication - TCP/UDP/IP address important
3. Computer architecture - pipelining important
4. Structural programming/OOP - go back to basics (like when we used to write our own strcpy)
                                know the "grammar" (I guess inheritance/polymorphism/overloading etc.)

* 30 questions (2 from each topic - see CSE notice board for list) each having 5 marks: (5 * 30 = 150)
* if you manage to get 40 out of 150 (yes, that's 40 - not 140) you are pretty much getting into masters program
* the highest marks is generally around 80 (so 40 isn't that low actually :p)


What I'm studying
-----------------
(seriously, give me some suggestions here...including whether it's becoming overkill) 

1. DLD:
	- function implementation, function reduction using K-map
	- Flip Flops
	- Counters

2. Database:
	- basic queries
	- constraints
	- ER diagram
	- ACID principle
